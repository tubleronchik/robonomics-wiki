It's located in the root of the repository\n\n> **Requirements**\n> In order to install all dependencies run in the root of the repository folder:\n>\n> ```\n> pip install -r requirements.txt\n> ```\n>\n> Python3 is required!\n\nUsually in order to upload a firmware to your board follow these steps:\n\n1. Assemble the board and connect it to PC\n2. Edit a `config.yaml` in a corresponding folder (e.g. `boards/esp/tcp/config.yaml`)\n3. Run `python flash_firmware.py -s PATH_TO_FOLDER -c PATH_TO_CONFIG` where `PATH_TO_FOLDER` is a path to the desired firmware (e.g. `boards/esp/ping`) and `PATH_TO_CONFIG` is a path to the configuration file (e.g. `boards/esp/ping/config.yaml`)\n\n"}},"context":{}}
