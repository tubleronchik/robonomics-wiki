Find required device and follow the instructions on the screen. For more details refer to the user manual of your Xiaomi Gateway hub.\n\n## Add Gateway to Home Assistant\nBe sure that you're logged in you raspberry as `homeassistant` user, if not do the following:\n```bash\nsudo -u homeassistant -H -s\n```\n\nIn your Home Assistant:\n```\nhttp://<raspberry_address>:8123\n```\nGo to `Configuration/Integrations` and press `Add Intagration`. There you need to Find `Xiaomi Miio`:\n\n![integration](../images/home-assistant/integration.png)\n\nThen fill your username (or phone) and password from Mi Home account and choose your country server:\n\n![auth](../images/home-assistant/auth.png)\n\nPress `Submit` and choose your Hub (Aqara Hub in this example):\n\n![hub](../images/home-assistant/hub.png)\n\nPress `Submit` and you will be able to see your gateway in Integrations page.\n\n## Add Gateway to Home Assistant using Homekit Controller integration\n\nYou can also connect your hub to Aqara Home app on ios and then add it to Home Assistant through Homekit Controller integration. \n\nAdd your hub to the app using `add device` or `+` button. Right after your hub added to Aqara Home app you will be proposed to bind it with your Homekit account. \n\n![homekit](../images/home-assistant/homekit.png)\n\nWhen you see a menu like the picture, open your Home Assistant page:\n\n```\nhttp://<raspberry_address>:8123\n```\nGo to `Configuration/Integrations`. Here you can find your device discovered and click `Configure` button to add it by Homekit Controller integration. You have to enter pairing code of your device, which you can find on the sticker on your device.\n\n![configure1](../images/home-assistant/configure1.png)\n\n![configure2](../images/home-assistant/configure2.png)\n\n\n## Configuration file\n\nAfter you've added your devices, you need to add them in a `config.config` file with their seeds. Firstly in `Configuration/Entities` tab in your Home Assistant find entity ids of your devices:\n\n![entity_id](../images/home-assistant/entity_id.png)\n\nOpen the configuration file:\n```bash\nnano /srv/homeassistant/python_scripts/config.config\n```\nAnd add there information of your devices in the following format:\n\n```\n[device_name]\nIDS = ['entity_id1', 'entity_id2']\nSEED = word word word\n```\nWhere `device_name` is the name of your device (you can choose any name), `IDS` are entity ids of the data from the device (it may be one or more ids) and `SEED` is a mnemonic or raw seed from robonomics account to this device.\n\nAfter you fill the configuration file you need to get access token from Home Assistant. For that open your `profile` in the lower left corner:\n\n![profile](../images/home-assistant/profile.png)\n\nIn the end of the page find `Long-Lived Access Tokens` and press `create token`. Save it somewhere, you will not be able to see it again.\n\n![token](../images/home-assistant/token.png)\n\nNow run `create_config.py` script with your token:\n\n```bash\ncd /srv/homeassistant\nsource bin/activate\npython3 python_scripts/create_config.py --token <access_token>\n```\nAnd restart Home Assistant:\n```bash\nsystemctl restart home-assistant@homeassistant.service\n```\n\nYou can add the data from sensors to your homepage like in `Home Assistant setup` in the description to [Method 1](/docs/zigbee2-mqtt/).\n\nYou can see the data in [subscan](https://robonomics.subscan.io/), find your account and you will see datalog transactions. Data looks like this:\n\n![datalog_data](../images/home-assistant/datalog_data.png)\n\nYou can decrypt it with script `decrypt.py`, run it with the data from datalog:\n```bash\ncd /srv/homeassistant/\nsource bin/activate\npython3 python_scripts/decrypt.py <data>\n```\n"}},"context":{}}
