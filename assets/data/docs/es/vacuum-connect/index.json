For that open a configuration file on your raspberry pi:\n\n```bash\nnano /srv/homeassistant/python_scripts/config.config\n```\n\nAnd add information about vacuum to the end of the file:\n\n```\n[vacuum]\nIDS = ['vacuum.robot_vacuum']\nSEED = word word word word\n```\nWhere `vacuum.robot_vacuum` is Entity ID of the vacuum.\n\nAfter you fill the configuration file you need to get access token from Home Assistant if you don't have it yet. For that open your `profile` in the lower left corner:\n\n![profile](../images/home-assistant/profile.png)\n\nIn the end of the page find `Long-Lived Access Tokens` and press `create token`. Save it somewhere, you will not be able to see it again.\n\n![token](../images/home-assistant/token.png)\n\nNow run `create_config.py` script with your token:\n\n```bash\ncd /srv/homeassistant\npython3 python_scripts/create_config.py --token <access_token>\n```\n\nAnd restart Home Assistant:\n```bash\nsystemctl restart home-sistant@homeassistant.service\n```\n\nNow you can create datalog in your user account to command robot to Start Cleaning, to Pause or to Return to Base. The message must be encrypted, you can encrypt message with `encrypt.py` script:\n```bash\ncd /srv/homeassistant/python_scripts\nsource /srv/homeassistant/bin/activate\npython3 encrypt.py <message>\n```\nMessage format:\n- to pause: `{\"agent\": \"vacuum_start\"}`\n- to pause: `{\"agent\": \"vacuum_pause\"}`\n- to return to base: `{\"agent\": \"vacuum_return_to_base\"}`\n\n> `vacuum` in `vacuum_start` and other commands is the name of you device from config file.\n"}},"context":{}}
